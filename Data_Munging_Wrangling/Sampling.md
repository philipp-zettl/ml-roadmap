# Sampling
Sampling is the selection of a subset of individuals from within a statistical population to estimate charactersitics of the whole population. Samples are supposed to be representative of the population in question. Sampling has a lower cost and faster data collection than measuring the entire population and can provide insigts in cases where it is infeasible to sample an entire population.

Immagine we would ask every person on the planet wether they like the color "blue" or not.

There are many different methods how to sample and a better overview can be found on [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)#Sampling_methods).
